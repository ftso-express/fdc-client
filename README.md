# Flare Data Connector Client

Flare Data Connector client supports tha attestation process.
It does the following tasks:

- Queries Flare C-Chain indexer for signing policies, attestation requests, and bitVotes.
- Assigns the attestation requests to the correct voting rounds and begins their verification process.
- Provides bitVote for each round.
- Computes consensus bitVote for each round.
- For each round, provides Merkle root of Merkle tree build on hashes of the confirmed attestations.

The client has no direct interactions with the Flare blockchain/node. The data is read through C-Chain indexer and submitted through Flare System Client.

## Protocol

See [whitepaper](https://flare.network/wp-content/uploads/FDC_WP_171024_02.pdf).

## Tests

To run all tests locally and generate a coverage report:

```
$ ./gencover.sh
```

## Configurations

The configurations are set in `userConfig.toml` file in `configs` folder.

```toml
# options are: "coston", "songbird", "coston2", "flare"
chain = <chainName>

protocol_id = <protocolID>
```

### C-chain Indexer

The client needs access to C-chain indexer

```toml
[db]
host = "localhost"
port = 3306
database = "flare_ftso_indexer"
username = "root"
password = "root"
log_queries = false
```

### Rest Server

FSP client access data from FDC client through the rest server.

```toml
[rest_server]
# Addr optionally specifies the TCP address for the server to listen on, in the form "host:port". If empty, ":http" (port 80) is used. The service names are defined in RFC 6335 and assigned by IANA. See net.Dial for details of the address format.
addr = ":8080"
api_key_name = "X-API-KEY"
api_keys = ["12345", "123456"]
title = "FDC protocol data provider API"
fsp_sub_router_title = "FDC protocol data provider for FSP client"
fsp_sub_router_path = "/fsp"
da_sub_router_title = "DA endpoints"
da_sub_router_path = "/da"
version = "0.0.0"
swagger_path = "/api-doc"

```

### Attestation Types

For each supported attestation type, the ABI of the attestation response struct should be provided.
The ABI in json file should be saved in json file in `configs/abis` folder.
It is recommended for a file to be named `<attestationType>.json`.
In `userConfig.toml`, a path to the json file is specified.

For each supported source of an attestation type, an url and an API key of a verifier server should be specified.
In addition, LUT limit of the pair must be provided as a string representing a non-negative number smaller than $2^{64}$.

Each verifier needs a designated queue that is assigned by it name.
The same queue can be assigned to more than one verifier.

```toml
# Verifiers for <attestationType>
[verifiers.<attestationType>]
abi_path = "configs/abis/<attestationType>.json"

## <source1>
[verifiers.<attestationType>.Sources.<source1>]
url = "http://url/of/the/verifier1"
api_key = "api-key1"
lut_limit = "123124124"
queue = "queue1"


## <source1>
[verifiers.<attestationType>.Sources.<source2>]
url = "http://url/of/the/verifier2"
api_key = "api-key2"
lut_limit = "123124124"
queue = "queue2"
```

### Queues

A queue ensures that the calls to the verifier server do not exceed server's limitations.

Each queue has the following configs:

```toml
[queue.<queueName>]
max_dequeues_per_second = 100 # 0 for unlimited
max_workers = 10 # 0 for unlimited
max_attempts = 3
time_off = "2s" # time off after each unsuccessful attempt.
```

### System Configs

System configs for a pair of chain and protocol ID should be specified in
`configs/systemConfigs/<protrocolID>/<chain>.toml`

The client needs data from three contracts `Submit` for bitVotes, `Relay` for signing policies, and `FDC` for attestation requests.
The addresses must be specified in the systemConfig file.

```toml
[addresses]
submit_contract = "0x2cA6571Daa15ce734Bbd0Bf27D5C9D16787fc33f"
relay_contract = "0x32D46A1260BB2D8C9d5Ab1C9bBd7FF7D7CfaabCC"
fdc_contract = "0xCf6798810Bc8C0B803121405Fee2A5a9cc0CA5E5"
voter_registry_contract = "0xE2c06DF29d175Aa0EcfcD10134eB96f8C94448A3"

```

The timestamp of the start of the first reward epoch (T0) and length of reward epoch have to be specified.

```toml
[timing]
t0 = 1658429955 # in seconds
reward_epoch_length = 240 # in voting rounds
```
